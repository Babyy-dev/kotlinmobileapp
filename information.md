KAPPA - OFFICIAL PROJECT DOCUMENT
Functional, Technical and Contractual Specification (Final Version)

Language: English

CHAPTER 1 - WHAT THE KAPPA APP IS

1. What the KAPPA app is (consolidated text for continuous review)

KAPPA is a mobile digital entertainment application with live audio streaming, based on internal virtual currencies (coins and diamonds). It enables interaction between users through audio rooms, digital gifts, minigames (slots) and a controlled, auditable internal economy.

The app operates with a hierarchical user structure, where each profile has well-defined roles and permissions, ensuring control, traceability and stability of the entire economic dynamics of the system.

KAPPA is not a financial application, does not operate as a bank, and does not offer financial services to the public.
The main dynamics of the application occur exclusively through internal virtual currencies, used only within the KAPPA ecosystem for digital entertainment purposes.

However, KAPPA includes an internal rewards system, in which certain users - after meeting minimum criteria defined by the platform - may request conversion of accumulated values for external receipt. These payments are exceptional, non-automatic and administratively controlled, and do not characterize an open or automatic financial operation. The user must request the reward for the app to process payment.

The conversion unit used in the rewards system is based on diamonds, as follows:

600,000 diamonds = USD 10

The user may request rewards in multiples of 600,000 diamonds, such as:

600,000 = USD 10

1,200,000 = USD 20

1,800,000 = USD 30

and so on

If the user has a balance above the minimum multiple, the excess is not lost and remains accumulated in the account.

Example: if the user has 700,000 diamonds, they can request 600,000 diamonds (USD 10), leaving 100,000 diamonds accumulated.

Minimum conditions for external reward requests:

USD 50 or more for:

bank transfer

PIX

cryptocurrency USDT (TRC20 network)

Payoneer

From USD 10 for:

agency payment

All payments:

must be requested manually by the user

are subject to fees according to the chosen payout method

undergo internal validation

do not happen automatically

do not guarantee earnings

1.1 Core operating concept (coins and diamonds)

The application uses coins and diamonds as internal virtual units, each with distinct roles inside the KAPPA ecosystem.

Coins

Coins represent the system's spending unit, used for:

playing minigames (slots)

sending digital gifts

sending fixed gifts

sending multiplier gifts

acquiring virtual items, such as:

avatar accessories

room backgrounds

any item or feature available within the app

All consumption inside the app is performed exclusively with coins.

Coins can be obtained through:

in-app purchase

distribution by authorized users (User Master or Reseller)

conversion of accumulated gifts/diamonds, according to system rules

Diamonds

Diamonds represent the receiving and accumulation unit, tied to received gifts, used as a basis for:

internal conversion

rewards system

potential external conversion requests, under platform rules

Basic conversion dynamics (individual gift)

When user X sends a gift to user Y using coins, user Y does not receive coins, but instead receives the equivalent value in diamonds.

Example:

User X spends 10,000 coins sending a gift

User Y receives 10,000 diamonds

Rooms and group distribution (28 seats)

Each room supports up to 28 simultaneous active users (28 seats).

When user X, inside a room, selects all online users and sends a gift from the multiplier gift group, the following rule applies:

Multiplier gift (group send)

Unit cost of the gift: 20 coins per user

Sending to 28 users:

total cost per send: 560 coins

For this type of gift:

users do not receive full diamonds

each online user receives only 10% of the gift value

Example:

gift costs 20 coins

each online user receives 2 diamonds

Multiplier system

Gifts from the multiplier group may or may not be multiplied, according to probabilistic rules defined by the system.

Possible multiplication factors:

2x - frequency: 40%

5x - frequency: 20%

10x - frequency: 10%

100x - frequency: 1.6%

250x - frequency: 0.6%

500x - frequency: 0.3%

1000x - frequency: 0.1%

Multiplier application:

is determined exclusively by the system

occurs at the moment the gift is sent

does not affect the amount of diamonds distributed for multiplier gifts (the 10% rule still applies)

does not affect commission

only increases the sender's coin balance, according to the app's internal logic

System control and integrity

All dynamics involving coins, diamonds, gifts, multipliers and rooms are:

recorded

auditable

controlled by the system

monitored by the User Master

The system ensures:

no improper currency creation

no unjustified balance loss

all conversions follow clear mathematical rules

1.2 User types and responsibilities

KAPPA has a hierarchical user structure, in which each type has specific permissions, limits and responsibilities, ensuring internal economy control, traceability and stability.

There are four user types:

1) User Master (Administrator / App Owner)

1.3 Live audio streaming and rooms (adjusted version)

KAPPA provides a live audio streaming system that occurs inside rooms, which are the main interaction environment and the main place where the platform's economy moves.

Rooms are always linked to an agency and allow users to:

interact by live audio

send/receive digital gifts

generate movement of coins, diamonds and commissions

Room structure

Each room has up to 28 seats, allowing up to 28 active users simultaneously.

Users can:

join as listeners

request a seat to enable live audio participation

Seat modes:

Blocked seats: user requests a seat and the room admin decides whether to allow it.

Free seats: any user can take a seat automatically, regardless of the agency they belong to.

Only users who are seated and online can:

receive digital gifts

participate in group interactions

Users who are only in the chat, watching or listening without taking a seat:

do not receive gifts

do not participate in group interactions

can send gifts, multiplier or not, only to seated users

Room creation and administration

Rooms can be created by:

Agency Owner

Reseller, when also enabled as an Agency Owner

Linking rules:

each room is always associated with one specific agency

an agency may have more than one active room at the same time

all rooms remain linked to their origin agency

Room administrator can:

manage room users

control basic permissions (free/blocked seats, audio participation, etc.)

monitor overall movement of coins, diamonds and gifts

Control, security and audit

All room and live audio operations are:

recorded, especially related to:

gift sending

diamond creation and distribution

coin receipt and movement

economic records and conversions

auditable

monitored by the system

supervised by the User Master

The system ensures:

no economic movement occurs outside room context

no balance losses occur

no inconsistencies between coins, diamonds and commissions

1.4 App purpose

The purpose of KAPPA is to create a mobile digital entertainment ecosystem with live audio streaming, designed to be stable, scalable and controlled, where users interact through rooms, digital gifts and minigames using internal virtual currencies.

KAPPA is designed to:

enable real-time social interaction by audio

drive engagement through gifts, multipliers and games

allow creation and growth of agencies and communities

maintain a balanced, transparent and auditable internal economy

KAPPA aims to guarantee:

operational security, avoiding balance loss or inconsistencies

full control of the internal economy, under User Master supervision

a smooth, stable experience for all user types

clear, mathematically consistent rules for coins, diamonds, commissions and rewards

The app is not intended to operate financial services, is not a bank, and does not offer financial products to the public.
External conversions occur only exceptionally, in a controlled manner, and upon user request, respecting minimum criteria, applicable fees and internal validation.

KAPPA is built to:

support gradual growth of users and rooms

allow the User Master to adjust rules without structural impact

meet publishing requirements for Android and iOS stores

CHAPTER 2 - KAPPA APP FLOWS

This chapter describes the app's operational flows, detailing how each user type interacts with the system from first access to advanced use of rooms, gifts, currencies and rewards.

Flows are defined to ensure:

system stability

clear permissions

internal economy integrity

consistent user experience

2.1 App entry flow (Onboarding)

User installs and opens KAPPA.

The app shows the splash screen and loads initial settings.

User chooses:

create an account

login with an existing account

After login, the system:

generates or validates a unique user ID

loads coin and diamond balances

identifies user type (User Master, Reseller, Agency Owner or Common User)

User is routed to the Home screen.

If connection fails:

the app shows a warning

blocks critical actions

does not lose local data

2.2 Agency binding flow (adjusted version)

When creating an account, the Common User can:

choose an existing agency, or

be invited by an agency

Once bound to an agency:

the user participates in the agency's rooms

all interactions while online in any room count toward the commission of the agency the user is bound to

if the user enters a room that belongs to another agency, results still count exclusively toward the user's bound agency commission and do not count toward the room owner agency

Agency binding rules

Agency binding can be:

permanent

released by the agency

released by paying a penalty of 400,000 coins, paid to the User Master

changed according to rules defined by the system or the User Master

All binding changes are:

recorded

auditable

system-controlled

2.3 Main navigation flow

After login, user can access:

Home

coin balance

diamond balance

rooms access

store access

Rooms

list of active rooms

Profile

user data

movement history

Settings

language

audio

legal information

2.4 Room entry flow (with seating and chat rules)

User selects an active room.

Upon entering, user:

joins as a listener

sees seated users and available seats

To participate by audio:

requests a seat

waits for approval (if seats are blocked)

or seats automatically (if seats are free)

When seated in a room:

audio is enabled

user can:

receive gifts

send gifts

user participates in group interactions

Listener user (no seat):

can only send gifts

can write in chat

does not receive gifts

does not join group interactions

Mandatory chat features:

ability to mention (@) a user, making it easier to direct messages

two-way automatic translation, with the following behavior:

user writes in their native language

the system sends the message automatically translated into the recipient's language

translation applies to both sent and received messages

2.5 Gift sending flow
Individual gift

User selects a seated recipient.

Chooses a gift.

System:

debits sender coins

credits recipient diamonds

records the transaction

updates agency commission (Chapter 3)

Group gift

User selects group send.

System identifies seated and online users.

Calculates total coin cost.

Applies multiplier (when applicable) according to system rules.

Distributes diamonds according to gift type rule (100% or 10%).

Records all movement.

2.6 Minigame flow (slots) - adjusted version

User opens the minigame.

Sets bet amount in coins.

Starts the spin.

System calculates the result.

User's coin balance is updated.

Result is shown to the user.

Important:
Minigames do not directly impact diamonds.
Minigames award coins only, and the gift/diamond flow depends on the specific minigame model adopted.

2.7 Diamond conversion flow - adjusted version

User accumulates diamonds by receiving gifts.

User can:

keep diamonds

convert diamonds into coins

Conversion rules:

conversion follows fixed mathematical rules

every conversion is:

recorded

auditable

conversion can be performed in multiples of 2 diamonds, where:

each 2 diamonds = 1 coin

2.8 External reward request flow

User opens the rewards area.

System checks:

diamond minimum

payout method type

User selects:

amount (multiples of 600,000 diamonds)

payout method

User confirms request.

System:

temporarily locks the requested diamonds

sends the request for administrative processing

After validation:

payout is executed

status is updated in the app

No automatic payouts.

preserve balances and history

log errors for audit

CHAPTER 3 - AGENCY COMMISSION MATHEMATICAL RULES

(adjusted and consolidated)

This chapter defines how agency commission is calculated, the correct calculation base, which events generate commission, and how crediting works, ensuring economic consistency and auditability.

3.1 Fundamental commission principle

Commission belongs to the agency the user is bound to, regardless of which room the user is in.

The agency that owns the room does not automatically receive commission.

Commission is generated by activity of users bound to an agency, not by room ownership.

Key rule:

Commission follows the user's agency binding, not the room.

3.2 Events that generate and do not generate commission
Events that generate commission

Commission is generated exclusively from diamonds effectively received by users bound to an agency, in these cases:

receiving individual gifts

receiving group gifts

receiving multiplier gifts (considering only the portion converted to diamonds)

Events that do not generate commission

diamonds-to-coins conversion

minigames (slots)

internal coin transfers (User Master / Reseller)

3.3 Commission calculation base

Commission base is the total amount of diamonds effectively received by users bound to the agency during the apportionment period.

Commission is not calculated on coins

Commission is not calculated on multiplied values

Commission is calculated only on real diamonds received

Important:

Multipliers do not change the commission base

Multipliers do not increase diamonds distributed for multiplier gifts and do not increase commission

Multipliers only affect the sender's coin balance, per app logic

Base formula:
Agency Commission = (Total diamonds received by bound users x 2.2 USD) / 620,000

3.4 Commission value / percentage

Commission is defined by the User Master, and can vary by:

agency

agency level

internal campaigns

The system must allow:

different commission values per agency

changes without retroactive impact

full audit control by the User Master

Current reference model:

Agency receives USD 2.20 per 620,000 diamonds accumulated by its bound users.

3.5 Practical examples
Example 1 - Individual and group gifts

Rules:

All received gifts convert fully to diamonds

Exception: multiplier-group gifts convert only 10% to diamonds

Scenario:

User A sends:

gift of 200,000 coins to User B
-> User B receives 200,000 diamonds

gifts of 210,000 coins to Users C and D
-> each receives 210,000 diamonds

User E earned 310,000 diamonds in the week (insufficient for weekly withdrawal)

Agency total diamonds:

200,000 + 210,000 + 210,000 + 310,000 = 930,000 diamonds

Agency commission:

(930,000 x 2.2 USD) / 620,000 = 3.3 USD

-> Agency receives USD 3.30.

Next week:

User E earns another 310,000 diamonds

Total reaches 620,000 diamonds, enabling first USD 10 reward request

Agency receives commission only on week 2's 310,000 diamonds, since week 1's portion was already accounted for.

Example 2 - Multiplier gift with multiplier

User A (Agency X)

Sends multiplier gift:

cost: 20 coins per user

28 users online

total cost: 560 coins

Conversion:

only 10% becomes diamonds

each user receives 2 diamonds

Applied multiplier: 100x

does not affect diamonds amount

does not affect commission

only increases the sender's coin balance

Binding distribution:

20 users bound to Agency X

8 users bound to other agencies

-> Each agency counts only diamonds of its own bound users.

Multipliers do not increase or reduce commission.

3.6 Commission crediting

Commission is credited:

automatically

in diamonds

to the agency wallet

Crediting may occur:

immediately after the event

or in batch (system-configurable)

All commissions are:

recorded

auditable

linked to specific events

traceable by period, user and room

3.7 System guarantees

The system guarantees:

no commission without real diamonds

no duplicated commission

no inconsistencies among coins, diamonds and commissions

no manual commission creation/edition without User Master permission
